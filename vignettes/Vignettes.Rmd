  ## Description

  `QCscATAC` is an R package that will set up the Quality Control and eliminate low-quality data from obtained scATAC-seq data set before any pre-processing analysis. Generally speaking, this package will improve the data quality from raw scATAC-seq data set, and thus increase the quality (fast analysis speed, smaller batch effects, lower redundant cells for dimension reduction) of pre-processing analysis.

The package is developed under R 4.1.1 in Mac.

## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

  ``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Yue-Zhou0429/QCscATAC", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("QC")
```

To run the Shiny app: Under construction

## Overview

``` r
ls("package:QCscATAC")
data(package = "QCscATAC") # optional
```

`QCscATAC` contains 2 functions to enforce quality control on the import data, and 3 function to output UMAP, TSS enrichment plot and Fragment Size Distribution plot as reference.


``` r
browseVignettes("QCscATAC")
```

An overview of the package is illustrated below.
